# MABOS Agents

1. action.py:
This file likely defines the Action class, which represents actions that agents can perform. Actions are fundamental to the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture. They are the concrete steps agents take to achieve their goals.

Relevance: Actions are crucial for all agents in the MAS, as they define what agents can do to affect their environment and achieve their goals.

Interactions: All agents will use actions defined in this file.

2. agent_role.py:
This file defines the AgentRole class, which represents different roles that agents can take on within the MAS.

Relevance: Roles allow for specialization and division of labor within the MAS, enabling agents to focus on specific tasks or responsibilities.

Interactions: The SecurityAgent and MaintenanceAgent explicitly use AgentRole. Other agents likely use roles as well to define their responsibilities within the system.

3. agent_skill.py:
This file defines various skills that agents can possess, such as CommunicationSkill, ExecutionSkill, LearningSkill, PerceptionSkill, and PlanningSkill.

Relevance: Skills provide agents with specific capabilities, allowing them to perform specialized tasks within the MAS.

Interactions: The BusinessPlanAgent explicitly uses these skills. Other agents likely incorporate these skills to enhance their capabilities.

4. belief.py:
This file defines the Belief class, which represents an agent's beliefs about the world.

Relevance: Beliefs are a core component of the BDI architecture, representing an agent's understanding of its environment.

Interactions: All agents in the MAS use beliefs to make decisions and plan actions.

5. agent.py:
This file defines the base Agent class, which serves as the foundation for all agents in the system.

This comprehensive analysis shows how the 39 agents work together to create a robust, flexible, and intelligent Multi-Agent System capable of handling complex business processes and adapting to changing environments. The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, allowing for specialized agents to handle specific tasks while meta agents manage the overall system behavior and evolution.

Now, let's analyze each agent and how they are organized to execute the business MAS's goals and tasks:

1. Core Agents:
   These agents handle specific tasks within the MAS:

   - BusinessAgent: Likely handles business-specific logic and decision-making.
   - CodeGenerationAgent: Responsible for generating code based on specifications.
   - LLMAgent: Utilizes language models for natural language processing tasks.
   - ProactiveAgent: Takes initiative in pursuing goals and planning actions.
   - ReactiveAgent: Responds to environmental stimuli based on predefined rules.

2. Meta Agents:
   These agents manage the overall MAS architecture and lifecycle:

   - AgentDesignAgent: Designs individual agents and their capabilities.
   - ArchitectureDesignAgent: Designs the overall MAS architecture.
   - DeploymentAgent: Handles the deployment of the MAS.
   - ImplementationAgent: Implements the designed MAS components.
   - IntegrationAgent: Manages the integration of various MAS components.
   - OptimizationAgent: Optimizes the MAS performance.
   - RequirementsAnalysisAgent: Analyzes and manages system requirements.
   - StrategicMetaAgent: Handles high-level strategic planning.
   - TacticalMetaAgent: Manages tactical-level planning and execution.
   - TestingAndVerificationAgent: Conducts testing and verification of the MAS.

3. Agent Models:
   These models define the core components of the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture:

   - Action: Represents actions that agents can perform.
   - Agent: The base agent class with BDI components.
   - AgentRole: Defines roles that agents can take on.
   - AgentSkill: Represents skills that agents can possess.
   - Belief: Represents an agent's beliefs about the world.
   - Desire: Represents an agent's desires or goals.
   - Goal: Represents specific goals for agents to achieve.
   - Intention: Represents an agent's commitment to achieving a goal.
   - Plan: Represents a plan to achieve a goal.
   - Task: Represents individual tasks within a plan.

The organization of these components allows for a flexible and modular MAS architecture. The core agents handle specific business tasks, while the meta agents manage the overall system. The agent models provide the foundation for implementing the BDI architecture, allowing agents to reason about their environment, set goals, and plan actions.

Now, let's illustrate the architecture using PlantUML diagrams:
