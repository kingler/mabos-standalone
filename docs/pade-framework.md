Integrate PADE, SPADE-BDI, and the Rule Engine to create a more comprehensive multi-agent system with BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) capabilities and rule-based decision making. Here's an overview of how you could combine these frameworks:

1. Use PADE as the base multi-agent framework:
   PADE provides a solid foundation for developing multi-agent systems in Python. It offers features like agent communication, behaviors, and a runtime environment.

2. Integrate SPADE-BDI for BDI capabilities:
   SPADE-BDI is a plugin for the SPADE framework that implements BDI agents. While PADE and SPADE are different frameworks, you can adapt SPADE-BDI concepts to work with PADE agents.

3. Incorporate the Rule Engine for decision making:
   The Rule Engine can be used within your agents to evaluate complex conditions and make decisions based on the agent's beliefs and goals.

Here's a conceptual example of how you might combine these frameworks:

```python
from pade.core.agent import Agent
from pade.acl.aid import AID
from pade.behaviours.protocols import FipaRequestProtocol
from rule_engine import Rule

class BDIAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(BDIAgent, self).__init__(aid=aid)
        self.beliefs = {}
        self.desires = []
        self.intentions = []
        self.rule_engine = self.setup_rule_engine()

    def setup_rule_engine(self):
        rules = [
            Rule('belief("enemy_nearby") and not belief("has_weapon")'),
            Rule('belief("has_mission") and belief("mission_complete")')
        ]
        return rules

    def add_belief(self, belief, value):
        self.beliefs[belief] = value

    def remove_belief(self, belief):
        if belief in self.beliefs:
            del self.beliefs[belief]

    def evaluate_rules(self):
        context = {'belief': lambda x: x in self.beliefs}
        for rule in self.rule_engine:
            if rule.matches(context):
                self.handle_rule_match(rule)

    def handle_rule_match(self, rule):
        # Implement logic for when a rule matches
        pass

class MyAgent(BDIAgent):
    def __init__(self, aid):
        super(MyAgent, self).__init__(aid=aid)
        self.behaviours.append(self.MyBehaviour())

    class MyBehaviour(FipaRequestProtocol):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

        async def handle_request(self, message):
            content = message.content
            self.agent.add_belief("received_message", content)
            self.agent.evaluate_rules()
            # Respond to the message based on beliefs and rule evaluation

if __name__ == '__main__':
    agent = MyAgent(AID(name="agent@localhost:5000"))
    agent.start()
```

This example demonstrates:

1. A `BDIAgent` class that extends PADE's `Agent` class, incorporating beliefs, desires, and intentions.
2. Integration of the Rule Engine to evaluate conditions based on the agent's beliefs.
3. A custom `MyAgent` class that uses the BDI concepts and includes a FIPA protocol behavior.

To make this work, you'd need to:

1. Adapt SPADE-BDI concepts to work within the PADE framework, as they're designed for different base frameworks.
2. Implement the BDI reasoning cycle, including updating beliefs, selecting plans, and executing intentions.
3. Use PADE's communication mechanisms instead of SPADE's.
4. Adjust the rule engine integration to work with your specific agent logic and decision-making process.

Remember that this is a conceptual integration and would require significant development and testing to create a fully functional system. The exact implementation details would depend on your specific requirements and how you want the agents to behave in your multi-agent system.

To integrate SymbolicAI and Owlready2 into a technology stack for building a goal-oriented BDI multiagent system for business and software development, you could approach it as follows:

1. Use SymbolicAI as the core framework for building neuro-symbolic AI agents:

- Leverage SymbolicAI's ability to use large language models (LLMs) as the foundation for agents
- Utilize its composable operations and expressions to define agent behaviors
- Take advantage of its stream processing and clustering capabilities for handling large amounts of data

2. Use Owlready2 to define and manage ontologies that represent the knowledge domain:

- Define classes, properties, and individuals to model the business and software development domains
- Use Owlready2's reasoning capabilities to infer new knowledge
- Leverage its ability to import/export ontologies in various formats

3. Integrate the two libraries:

- Use SymbolicAI expressions and operations to manipulate and query the ontologies defined with Owlready2
- Use Owlready2 ontologies to provide structured knowledge to guide SymbolicAI's language model outputs
- Implement BDI concepts (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) using a combination of SymbolicAI's symbolic manipulation and Owlready2's ontological representations

Here's a high-level example of how you might structure this:

```python
import symai as ai
from owlready2 import *

# Load domain ontology
onto = get_ontology("http://example.org/business-software-dev.owl").load()

class BDIAgent(ai.Expression):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.beliefs = onto.Belief()
        self.desires = onto.Desire()
        self.intentions = onto.Intention()
    
    def perceive(self, perception):
        # Use SymbolicAI to process perception and update beliefs
        processed = ai.Symbol(perception).clean().translate().outline()
        new_belief = onto.Belief(name=processed.value)
        self.beliefs.has_belief.append(new_belief)
    
    def deliberate(self):
        # Use SymbolicAI to reason about beliefs and generate desires
        belief_text = " ".join([b.name for b in self.beliefs.has_belief])
        desires = ai.Symbol(belief_text).query("Generate desires based on these beliefs:")
        for desire in desires.value.split("\n"):
            new_desire = onto.Desire(name=desire)
            self.desires.has_desire.append(new_desire)
    
    def plan(self):
        # Use SymbolicAI to generate plans (intentions) based on desires
        desire_text = " ".join([d.name for d in self.desires.has_desire])
        plans = ai.Symbol(desire_text).query("Generate plans to achieve these desires:")
        for plan in plans.value.split("\n"):
            new_intention = onto.Intention(name=plan)
            self.intentions.has_intention.append(new_intention)
    
    def act(self):
        # Execute the top intention
        if self.intentions.has_intention:
            top_intention = self.intentions.has_intention[0]
            action = ai.Symbol(top_intention.name).execute()
            print(f"Agent {self.name} executing: {action}")
            self.intentions.has_intention.remove(top_intention)

# Create and run an agent
agent = BDIAgent("BusinessDev1")
agent.perceive("New project requirements received")
agent.deliberate()
agent.plan()
agent.act()
```

This example demonstrates how you could:

1. Use Owlready2 to define and work with a domain ontology
2. Use SymbolicAI for natural language processing and reasoning
3. Implement a BDI agent that uses both libraries

You'd need to further develop the ontology, add more sophisticated reasoning, and expand the agent's capabilities, but this provides a starting point for integrating these two powerful libraries into a neuro-symbolic BDI multiagent system.

       class ProjectManagementGoal(Goal):
           pass

   onto.save()
   ```

3. Create BDI agents using PADE and SPADE-BDI:

   ```python
   from pade.misc.utility import display_message
   from pade.core.agent import Agent as PADEAgent
   from pade.acl.aid import AID
   from spade_bdi.bdi import BDIAgent

   class BusinessAgent(PADEAgent, BDIAgent):
       def __init__(self, aid, password, asl_file):
           PADEAgent.__init__(self, aid)
           BDIAgent.__init__(self, aid.name, password, asl_file)

       async def setup(self):
           await BDIAgent.setup(self)
           display_message(self.aid.localname, "Agent initialized")
   ```

4. Implement agent behaviors using AgentSpeak (ASL):

   developer.asl:
   ```java
   !develop_code.

   +!develop_code : true <-
       .print("Starting code development");
       !write_code;
       !test_code;
       .print("Code development completed").

   +!write_code : true <-
       .print("Writing code");
       .wait(2000).

   +!test_code : true <-
       .print("Testing code");
       .wait(1000).
   ```

   manager.asl:
   ```java
   !manage_project.

   +!manage_project : true <-
       .print("Starting project management");
       !assign_tasks;
       !monitor_progress;
       .print("Project management completed").

   +!assign_tasks : true <-
       .print("Assigning tasks to developers");
       .wait(1500).

   +!monitor_progress : true <-
       .print("Monitoring project progress");
       .wait(2000).
   ```

5. Implement a rule engine for decision making:

   ```python
   import rule_engine

   class BusinessRules:
       def __init__(self):
           self.rules = [
               rule_engine.Rule('task.priority == "high" and task.status == "pending"'),
               rule_engine.Rule('project.deadline - current_date <= 7')
           ]

       def evaluate(self, context):
           return [rule.matches(context) for rule in self.rules]
   ```

6. Integrate SymbolicAI for advanced reasoning:

   ```python
   import symai as ai

   class SymbolicReasoner:
       def __init__(self):
           self.model = ai.Symbolic()

       def reason(self, context):
           query = f"Given the context: {context}, what action should be taken?"
           return self.model.reason(query)
   ```

7. Use Roboflow Inference for image-based task analysis:

   ```python
   from inference import InferenceHTTPClient

   class TaskAnalyzer:
       def __init__(self, api_key):
           self.client = InferenceHTTPClient(api_key=api_key)

       def analyze_task_image(self, image_path):
           result = self.client.infer(image_path)
           return result
   ```

8. Implement Neo4j for storing and querying the project graph:

   ```python
   from neo4j import GraphDatabase

   class ProjectGraph:
       def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
           self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

       def add_task(self, task_name, assigned_to):
           with self.driver.session() as session:
               session.run("CREATE (:Task {name: $name, assigned_to: $assigned_to})",
                           name=task_name, assigned_to=assigned_to)

       def get_developer_tasks(self, developer_name):
           with self.driver.session() as session:
               result = session.run("MATCH (t:Task) WHERE t.assigned_to = $name RETURN t.name",
                                    name=developer_name)
               return [record["t.name"] for record in result]
   ```

9. Main application to tie everything together:

   ```python
   from pade.misc.utility import start_loop
   from pade.acl.aid import AID
   import asyncio

   async def main():
       # Initialize ontology
       onto = get_ontology("http://example.org/business-dev-ontology.owl").load()

       # Create agents
       developer = BusinessAgent(AID("developer@localhost:5000"), "password", "developer.asl")
       manager = BusinessAgent(AID("manager@localhost:5001"), "password", "manager.asl")

       # Initialize other components
       rules = BusinessRules()
       reasoner = SymbolicReasoner()
       task_analyzer = TaskAnalyzer("your_roboflow_api_key")
       project_graph = ProjectGraph("bolt://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password")

       # Start agents
       await developer.start()
       await manager.start()

       # Example workflow
       developer.bdi.set_belief("current_task", "implement_feature_x")
       manager.bdi.set_belief("project_status", "on_track")

       context = {"task": {"priority": "high", "status": "pending"}, "project": {"deadline": "2023-12-31"}}
       rule_results = rules.evaluate(context)
       
       reasoning_result = reasoner.reason("The project is on track, but there's a high-priority pending task.")
       
       task_image_analysis = task_analyzer.analyze_task_image("task_diagram.jpg")
       
       project_graph.add_task("implement_feature_x", "developer")
       developer_tasks = project_graph.get_developer_tasks("developer")

       # Run the agent loop
       start_loop([developer, manager])

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
   ```

This implementation creates a goal-oriented BDI multiagent system for business and software development by:

1. Using Owlready2 to define an ontology for the domain.
2. Creating BDI agents with PADE and SPADE-BDI.
3. Implementing agent behaviors in AgentSpeak.
4. Using a rule engine for decision making.
5. Integrating SymbolicAI for advanced reasoning.
6. Employing Roboflow Inference for image-based task analysis.
7. Utilizing Neo4j for storing and querying the project graph.

The main application ties all these components together, creating a sophisticated system that can handle complex business and software development scenarios. You'll need to adapt and expand this framework based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Based on the search results and my knowledge, there isn't a widely adopted Python library specifically for implementing Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) in the context of multi-agent systems. However, we can create a custom implementation using ACL best practices. Here's a detailed step-by-step instruction to implement an ACL system in Python:

1. Define the Message Structure:
   Create a message class that encapsulates the essential components of an ACL message. Include fields such as:
   - Sender: The agent sending the message
   - Receiver: The intended recipient(s) of the message
   - Performative: The type of communicative act (e.g., inform, request, propose)
   - Content: The actual information being communicated
   - Language: The content language (e.g., KIF, FIPA-SL)
   - Ontology: The ontology used for interpreting the content
   - Conversation ID: A unique identifier for the conversation thread
   - Protocol: The interaction protocol being followed (e.g., FIPA-Request, FIPA-Contract-Net)

2. Implement Performatives:
   Define a set of performatives based on FIPA-ACL standards. Common performatives include:
   - Inform: Telling another agent something
   - Request: Asking another agent to perform an action
   - Query: Asking for specific information
   - Propose: Suggesting a course of action
   - Accept/Reject: Responding to proposals
   Implement methods for each performative to handle the specific semantics and expected responses.

3. Create an Agent Class:
   Develop a base Agent class that includes:
   - A unique identifier for the agent
   - Methods for sending and receiving messages
   - A message queue for storing incoming messages
   - Basic reasoning capabilities to process messages and decide on actions

4. Implement Communication Protocols:
   Design and implement common interaction protocols, such as:
   - FIPA-Request: For simple request-response interactions
   - FIPA-Query: For information queries
   - FIPA-Contract-Net: For task allocation and negotiation
   Each protocol should define the sequence of messages and expected responses.

5. Develop a Message Transport System:
   Create a system for routing messages between agents. This could be a simple in-memory system for local agents or a network-based system for distributed agents. Ensure that messages are properly serialized and deserialized during transport.

6. Implement Ontology Support:
   Create a system for defining and managing ontologies. This should include:
   - A way to define concepts, predicates, and actions
   - Methods for checking semantic consistency of messages
   - Tools for translating between different ontologies if necessary

7. Add Conversation Management:
   Implement a conversation manager that:
   - Tracks ongoing conversations using conversation IDs
   - Manages the state of each conversation
   - Ensures that messages are processed in the correct order within a conversation

8. Create a Directory Facilitator (DF):
   Implement a DF service that allows agents to register their capabilities and find other agents with specific services. This should include methods for:
   - Registering agent services
   - Searching for agents with specific capabilities
   - Updating and removing service registrations

9. Implement Security Measures:
   Add security features such as:
   - Message encryption for sensitive communications
   - Agent authentication to verify the identity of communicating agents
   - Access control to restrict certain types of messages or actions

10. Develop Logging and Monitoring:
    Create a logging system to record all agent communications for debugging and analysis. Include features for:
    - Timestamping messages
    - Filtering and searching message logs
    - Visualizing communication patterns and agent interactions

11. Add Error Handling and Recovery:
    Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as:
    - Message timeout or delivery failure
    - Protocol violations or unexpected messages
    - Agent failures or disconnections

12. Create Testing and Simulation Tools:
    Develop tools for testing and simulating agent interactions, including:
    - Mock agents for testing specific scenarios
    - A simulation environment for running large-scale agent interactions
    - Analysis tools for evaluating system performance and agent behaviors

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive ACL system in Python that adheres to best practices in agent communication. This approach allows for flexibility in implementation while maintaining compatibility with standard ACL concepts and protocols.

Certainly! Here's a revised version of the instructions incorporating the advanced reasoning capabilities you mentioned, presented in markdown format with embedded Python code blocks:

# Advanced Reasoning Capabilities for BDI Multiagent System

## 1. Set up the environment

Install the additional libraries:

```bash
pip install z3-solver pysmt pyres sympy owlready2 neo4j
```

## 2. Create a ReasoningEngine class

This class will encapsulate various reasoning capabilities and provide a unified interface for agents to use.

```python
from z3 import *
from pysmt.shortcuts import *
from pyres import *
import sympy

class ReasoningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.z3_solver = Solver()
        self.pysmt_solver = Solver()
        self.pyres_kb = KnowledgeBase()
        
    def solve_constraint(self, constraints):
        self.z3_solver.reset()
        for constraint in constraints:
            self.z3_solver.add(constraint)
        if self.z3_solver.check() == sat:
            return self.z3_solver.model()
        return None
    
    def prove_theorem(self, axioms, theorem):
        with self.pysmt_solver:
            for axiom in axioms:
                self.pysmt_solver.add_assertion(axiom)
            return self.pysmt_solver.solve([Not(theorem)])
    
    def prove_fol(self, premises, conclusion):
        for premise in premises:
            self.pyres_kb.tell(premise)
        return self.pyres_kb.ask(conclusion)
    
    def symbolic_math(self, expression):
        return sympy.simplify(expression)
    
    def select_reasoning_method(self, problem_type):
        if problem_type == "constraint":
            return self.solve_constraint
        elif problem_type == "theorem":
            return self.prove_theorem
        elif problem_type == "fol":
            return self.prove_fol
        elif problem_type == "symbolic":
            return self.symbolic_math
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown problem type")
```

## 3. Extend the BDI Agent class

Modify the existing BusinessAgent class to incorporate the ReasoningEngine.

```python
from core.agents.core_agents.business_agent import BusinessAgent
from core.models.knowledge.reasoning.reasoning_engine import ReasoningEngine

class EnhancedBusinessAgent(BusinessAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.reasoning_engine = ReasoningEngine()
    
    def formulate_problem(self, problem_type, data):
        # Implement problem formulation logic
        pass
    
    def interpret_result(self, problem_type, result):
        # Implement result interpretation logic
        pass
    
    def reason(self, problem_type, data):
        problem = self.formulate_problem(problem_type, data)
        reasoning_method = self.reasoning_engine.select_reasoning_method(problem_type)
        result = reasoning_method(problem)
        return self.interpret_result(problem_type, result)
```

## 4. Update the ontology

Extend the existing ontology using Owlready2 to include concepts related to reasoning and problem-solving.

```python
from owlready2 import *

onto = get_ontology("http://example.org/business-ai-ontology.owl")

with onto:
    class Problem(Thing):
        pass

    class ConstraintProblem(Problem):
        pass

    class TheoremProvingProblem(Problem):
        pass

    class FOLProblem(Problem):
        pass

    class SymbolicMathProblem(Problem):
        pass

    class Solution(Thing):
        pass

    class Agent(Thing):
        pass

    class has_problem = ObjectProperty(domain=Agent, range=Problem)
    class has_solution = ObjectProperty(domain=Problem, range=Solution)
```

## 5. Implement reasoning behaviors

Create new agent behaviors that utilize the reasoning capabilities.

```python
class ReasoningBehavior:
    def identify_problem(self, agent):
        # Logic to identify problems requiring complex reasoning
        pass

    def formulate_problem(self, agent, problem_data):
        # Logic to formulate problems for the reasoning engine
        pass

    def interpret_results(self, agent, results):
        # Logic to interpret and act on reasoning results
        pass

    def execute(self, agent):
        problem = self.identify_problem(agent)
        if problem:
            formulated_problem = self.formulate_problem(agent, problem)
            results = agent.reason(formulated_problem.type, formulated_problem.data)
            self.interpret_results(agent, results)
```

## 6. Integrate reasoning with the rule engine

Modify the existing rule engine to incorporate reasoning results.

```python
from core.models.rules import Rule, Rules

class ReasoningRule(Rule):
    def condition(self, agent):
        # Condition to trigger complex reasoning
        pass

    def action(self, agent):
        # Action to perform reasoning and update agent state
        reasoning_behavior = ReasoningBehavior()
        reasoning_behavior.execute(agent)

# Add the reasoning rule to the rules engine
rules_engine = Rules()
rules_engine.add_rule(ReasoningRule())
```

## 7. Enhance symbolic AI integration

Update the SymbolicReasoner class to work in conjunction with the new reasoning capabilities.

```python
class SymbolicReasoner:
    def __init__(self, llm_model):
        self.llm_model = llm_model

    def natural_to_formal(self, natural_language):
        # Translate natural language to formal logic
        pass

    def formal_to_natural(self, formal_logic):
        # Translate formal logic to natural language
        pass

    def combine_symbolic_and_formal(self, symbolic_insights, formal_results):
        # Combine symbolic AI insights with formal reasoning results
        pass
```

## 8. Update the project graph

Modify the Neo4j-based ProjectGraph class to store and query reasoning-related data.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class ProjectGraph:
    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def add_reasoning_problem(self, problem_id, problem_type, description):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.run("""
                CREATE (p:ReasoningProblem {id: $id, type: $type, description: $desc})
            """, id=problem_id, type=problem_type, desc=description)

    def add_reasoning_solution(self, problem_id, solution_id, method_used, description):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.run("""
                MATCH (p:ReasoningProblem {id: $pid})
                CREATE (s:ReasoningSolution {id: $sid, method: $method, description: $desc})
                CREATE (p)-[:HAS_SOLUTION]->(s)
            """, pid=problem_id, sid=solution_id, method=method_used, desc=description)

    def query_reasoning_effectiveness(self, problem_type):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run("""
                MATCH (p:ReasoningProblem {type: $type})-[:HAS_SOLUTION]->(s:ReasoningSolution)
                RETURN s.method, count(*) as usage, avg(s.effectiveness) as avg_effectiveness
                ORDER BY avg_effectiveness DESC
            """, type=problem_type)
            return result.data()
```

This implementation provides a foundation for incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into the BDI multiagent system. It includes classes for the reasoning engine, enhanced business agent, ontology updates, reasoning behaviors, rule engine integration, symbolic AI enhancements, and project graph updates.

To fully implement all the features mentioned, you would need to expand on these base classes, adding more detailed logic for problem formulation, result interpretation, and integration with other system components. Additionally, you'd need to implement the reasoning coordinator, enhance agent communication protocols, create reasoning templates, implement learning and adaptation mechanisms, develop visualization tools, and integrate with external knowledge bases as described in the original instructions.
