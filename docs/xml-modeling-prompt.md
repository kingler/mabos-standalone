You are tasked with creating XML format code for enterprise architecture diagrams based on various modeling techniques. These diagrams will be used in a modeling management app and stored in a repository with versioning capabilities.

The supported diagram types are:
1. TOGAF visual diagrams
2. BPMN diagrams
3. Goal modeling based on Tropos
4. Rules / Rulesets
5. Topic maps
6. Ontologies

Please provide the diagram type you want to create:

<diagram_type>
{{DIAGRAM_TYPE}}
</diagram_type>

Based on the diagram type you've specified, I will provide instructions and a real-world example template for creating the XML code.

General XML formatting guidelines:
- Use proper indentation for nested elements
- Use descriptive element names
- Include relevant attributes where necessary
- Ensure all tags are properly closed

Here's a real-world example template for the {{DIAGRAM_TYPE}}:

<example>
[Insert appropriate XML template for the specified diagram type here]
</example>

To adapt this template for your specific use case:
1. Replace placeholder text with your actual data
2. Add or remove elements as needed to match your diagram's complexity
3. Ensure all relationships and connections are properly represented
4. Include any necessary metadata or attributes

Remember to save your XML diagram in the repository with appropriate versioning information. This will allow you to track changes and maintain a history of your enterprise architecture models over time.

When you're ready to create your XML diagram, please output your code within <xml_diagram> tags.
