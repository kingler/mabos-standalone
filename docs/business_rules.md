# Business Rules

To implement business rules with versioning using Git and store them in a repository, we can leverage a combination of a Business Rules Management System (BRMS) and Git for version control. This approach ensures that business rules are dynamic, executable, and versioned.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this system, including code examples:

### **1. Define Business Rules**

First, let's define some business rules in JSON format. These rules will be stored in a Git repository for version control.

```json
[
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "HighValueCustomer",
    "condition": "sum(purchase_history) > 500",
    "action": "add_vip_flag"
  },
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "ValidEmail",
    "condition": "is_valid_email(email)",
    "action": "standardize_email"
  },
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "LoyaltyDiscount",
    "condition": "loyalty_points > 100",
    "action": "apply_loyalty_discount"
  }
]
```

### **2. Store Rules in a Git Repository**

Create a Git repository to store the business rules. You can use the following commands to initialize a repository and commit the rules:

```bash
mkdir business-rules-repo
cd business-rules-repo
git init
echo '[
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "HighValueCustomer",
    "condition": "sum(purchase_history) > 500",
    "action": "add_vip_flag"
  },
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "ValidEmail",
    "condition": "is_valid_email(email)",
    "action": "standardize_email"
  },
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "ruleName": "LoyaltyDiscount",
    "condition": "loyalty_points > 100",
    "action": "apply_loyalty_discount"
  }
]' > business_rules.json
git add business_rules.json
git commit -m "Initial commit of business rules"
```

### **3. Implement a Business Rules Engine**

Next, implement a simple business rules engine in Python that can load rules from the Git repository, execute them, and manage versions.

#### **business_rules_engine.py**

```python
import json
import subprocess
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Callable

class BusinessRule:
    def __init__(self, name: str, condition: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], bool], action: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]):
        self.name = name
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

class BusinessRulesEngine:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        self.rules: List[BusinessRule] = []

    def load_rules(self, version: str):
        subprocess.run(["git", "-C", self.repo_path, "checkout", version], check=True)
        with open(f"{self.repo_path}/business_rules.json", "r") as file:
            rules_data = json.load(file)
            self.rules = [
                BusinessRule(
                    rule["ruleName"],
                    lambda data, cond=rule["condition"]: eval(cond, {}, data),
                    lambda data, act=rule["action"]: eval(act, {}, data)
                )
                for rule in rules_data
            ]

    def execute_rules(self, data: Dict[str, Any]):
        for rule in self.rules:
            if rule.condition(data):
                rule.action(data)

# Example functions used in business rules
def sum(purchase_history):
    return sum(purchase_history)

def is_valid_email(email):
    import re
    email_regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return re.match(email_regex, email) is not None

def add_vip_flag(data):
    data["is_vip"] = True

def standardize_email(data):
    data["email"] = data["email"].lower()

def apply_loyalty_discount(data):
    data["discount"] = min(data["loyalty_points"] // 100, 20)  # Max 20% discount

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = BusinessRulesEngine("path/to/business-rules-repo")
    engine.load_rules("main")  # Load the latest version of the rules

    customer_data = {
        "purchase_history": [100, 200, 150, 300],
        "email": "John.Doe@Example.com",
        "loyalty_points": 500
    }
    print("Original data:", customer_data)
    engine.execute_rules(customer_data)
    print("Data after applying business rules:", customer_data)
```

### **4. Version Management**

To manage versions of the business rules, you can create branches or tags in the Git repository. For example, to create a new version:

```bash
cd business-rules-repo
git checkout -b v1.1
# Make changes to business_rules.json
git add business_rules.json
git commit -m "Update business rules to version 1.1"
git tag v1.1
git push origin v1.1
```

### **5. Loading Specific Versions**

You can load specific versions of the business rules in the `BusinessRulesEngine` by checking out the corresponding branch or tag:

```python
# Load a specific version of the rules
engine.load_rules("v1.1")
```

### **Conclusion**

This approach demonstrates how to implement a dynamic and executable business rules engine with versioning using Git. The business rules are defined in JSON format, stored in a Git repository, and managed using Git commands. The `BusinessRulesEngine` class loads the rules from the repository, executes them on the provided data, and allows for version management by checking out specific branches or tags.

This setup provides a flexible and maintainable way to manage business rules, ensuring that changes can be tracked, audited, and rolled back if necessary.
