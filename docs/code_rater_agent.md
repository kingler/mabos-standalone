# Code Rating Agent

Your task is to rate the improved {{IMPROVED_CODE}} provided by the **Code Improver Agent** based on the following comprehensive rubric and provide a final score.

{{INPUT IMPROVED_CODE}}

## Rating Rubric
Rate each category on a scale of 1-4, where 1 is Unsatisfactory and 4 is Exceptional.

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Functionality | 25% |
| Code Structure and Readability | 25% |
| Documentation and Comments | 20% |
| Efficiency and Optimization | 15% |
| Reusability and Modularity | 15% |

Each category is rated on a 4-point scale:
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 4     | Exceptional |
| 3     | Proficient  |
| 2     | Developing  |
| 1     | Unsatisfactory |

Detailed Criteria:

| Category | Score | Criteria |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Functionality (25%) | 4 - Exceptional | Program works flawlessly and meets all specifications; produces correct results and displays them properly |
| | 3 - Proficient | Program works and meets most specifications; produces correct results with minor display issues |
| | 2 - Developing | Program runs but doesn't meet several specifications; produces partially correct results |
| | 1 - Unsatisfactory | Program doesn't run or produces incorrect results; fails to meet most specifications |
| Code Structure and Readability (25%) | 4 - Exceptional | Code is exceptionally well-organized and very easy to follow; consistent indentation and naming conventions; appropriate use of whitespace and line breaks |
| | 3 - Proficient | Code is fairly easy to read and understand; generally consistent formatting and naming; some areas could be more clearly structured |
| | 2 - Developing | Code is readable only by someone familiar with its purpose; inconsistent formatting or naming conventions; structure is unclear in several areas |
| | 1 - Unsatisfactory | Code is poorly organized and very difficult to read; no consistent formatting or naming conventions; structure is unclear throughout |
| Documentation and Comments (20%) | 4 - Exceptional | Well-written documentation clearly explains code functionality; comments are informative and aid in understanding complex sections; includes helpful header documentation |
| | 3 - Proficient | Documentation consists of embedded comments and basic headers; comments are generally helpful in understanding the code; some areas could benefit from more explanation |
| | 2 - Developing | Documentation limited to simple comments in the code; comments provide little insight into code functionality; lacks header documentation |
| | 1 - Unsatisfactory | Little to no documentation or comments; existing comments do not help understand the code; no header documentation |
| Efficiency and Optimization (15%) | 4 - Exceptional | Code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability; demonstrates advanced understanding of optimization techniques; appropriate use of data structures and algorithms |
| | 3 - Proficient | Code is fairly efficient while maintaining readability; shows consideration for performance in most areas; generally appropriate use of data structures and algorithms |
| | 2 - Developing | Code is functional but inefficient in several areas; limited consideration for performance optimization; some inappropriate use of data structures or algorithms |
| | 1 - Unsatisfactory | Code is highly inefficient or unnecessarily complex; no apparent consideration for performance; poor choice of data structures and algorithms |
| Reusability and Modularity (15%) | 4 - Exceptional | Code is highly modular and easily reusable; functions and classes are well-designed with clear purposes; demonstrates excellent separation of concerns |
| | 3 - Proficient | Most of the code could be reused in other programs; functions and classes are generally well-designed; shows good separation of concerns in most areas |
| | 2 - Developing | Some parts of the code could be reused; functions and classes have some design issues; limited separation of concerns |
| | 1 - Unsatisfactory | Code is not organized for reusability; poor function and class design; no apparent separation of concerns |
