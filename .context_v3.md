# Multi-Agent System (MAS) Framework with PADE Integration

This project implements a sophisticated Multi-Agent System (MAS) Framework designed for business development and operations. It combines advanced AI techniques, including BDI architecture, symbolic reasoning, and formal logic, to create a powerful and adaptive system for complex decision-making processes. The framework now integrates with PADE (Python Agent DEvelopment) for enhanced agent capabilities and communication.

## System Architecture

1. Agent Layer: PADE-based agents implementing various roles and behaviors
2. Core Services: Business logic and coordination services
3. Knowledge Management: Ontology and knowledge base management
4. Model Management: MDD tools and model transformation services
5. API Layer: FastAPI-based endpoints for external interactions
6. Persistence Layer: ArangoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval

## Knowledge Management System

The Knowledge Management System in MABOS is responsible for representing, storing, and retrieving domain knowledge. It utilizes ontology-based approaches and graph databases to create a flexible and powerful knowledge representation framework.

Key components include:
1. Ontology Management
2. Knowledge Graph
3. Semantic Reasoning Engine
4. Natural Language Interface

## Testing Framework

The MABOS testing framework ensures the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the system. It employs a comprehensive approach to testing, covering:

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
4. End-to-End Testing

The framework aims for a minimum of 90% code coverage across the entire codebase.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture when implementing agents
- Use TOGAF concepts for enterprise architecture alignment
- Implement the Tropos framework for agent-oriented software development
- Adopt a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach for system design and implementation
- Ensure proper integration between different reasoning techniques
- Incorporate knowledge management with ontologies, LLMs, and reasoning capabilities
- Maintain clear documentation for each component and its interactions
- Utilize PADE's agent development patterns and best practices
- Adhere to FIPA standards for agent communication
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing for agents and services
- Follow best practices in ontology engineering and knowledge graph design
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over quantity
