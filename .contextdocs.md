# Project Context Documentation

## Overview
This document provides context for the Multi-Agent System (MAS) Framework for Business Development and Operations project, which aims to develop a sophisticated platform for complex, goal-oriented, BDI multi-agent systems tailored for business applications.

## Project Structure
- `app/`: Contains the source code for the MAS framework
- `tests/`: Includes test files for various components of the system
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies
- `.context.md`: Contains project-wide context information
- `.contexignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored in context generation

## Key Components
1. **BDI Agents**: Implements the Belief-Desire-Intention architecture for intelligent agents.
2. **Reasoning Engine**: Handles complex decision-making processes.
3. **Ontology Manager**: Manages knowledge representation using Owlready2.
4. **Rule Engine**: Implements business rules and logic.
5. **Symbolic AI Integrator**: Integrates various symbolic AI techniques.
6. **Project Graph**: Represents project structure and relationships.
7. **Communication Protocol**: Facilitates agent communication.
8. **Reasoning Coordinator**: Coordinates different reasoning techniques.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture when implementing agents.
- Use TOGAF concepts for enterprise architecture alignment.
- Implement the Tropos framework for agent-oriented software development.
- Adopt a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach for system design and implementation.
- Ensure proper integration between different reasoning techniques.
- Maintain clear documentation for each component and its interactions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python as the primary programming language
- PADE and SPADE-BDI for multi-agent system development
- Owlready2 for ontology management
- ArangoDB for graph database operations
- Z3Py, PySMT, PyRes, and SymPy for various reasoning and symbolic AI tasks

## Future Directions
- Enhance integration with enterprise systems
- Develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities
- Implement advanced machine learning techniques within the BDI framework
- Create domain-specific agent templates for various business sectors
