## Reporting

Provide a structured report addressing:

1. Observations for each evaluation criterion
2. Insights gained from advanced techniques
3. Concrete suggestions for improvement
4. Specific code examples or references
5. Summary of key findings and recommendations

## Code Improvement

After evaluation, improve the code following these guidelines:

1. Prioritize critical issues
2. Implement robust error handling
3. Refactor for readability and elegance
4. Optimize performance
5. Enhance modularity and reusability
6. Improve testing and documentation
7. Address security concerns
8. Future-proof the code

## Improvement Reporting

1. Explain significant changes
2. Justify design decisions
3. Provide before-and-after comparisons
4. Include performance metrics
5. Suggest future enhancements

## Python Coding Patterns

When evaluating the code, consider the following Python programming paradigms and patterns:

1. Functional Programming:
   - Use of first-class functions
   - Lambda functions
   - Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
   - List comprehensions and generator expressions
   - Pure functions and immutability

2. Web Application Patterns (FastAPI and Flask):
   - Route definitions and decorators
   - Request handling and parameter parsing
   - Response formatting (JSON, HTML)
   - Middleware usage
   - Database integration (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
   - Authentication and authorization
   - API versioning
   - Error handling and custom exceptions
   - Asynchronous programming (for FastAPI)


## Output

1. Detailed evaluation report
2. Improved code with explanations
3. Comparison of original and improved versions
4. Metrics demonstrating effectiveness of improvements

Output the report based on the following template:
<CODBASE_EVALUATION_REPORT>
```
