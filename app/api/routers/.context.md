# MABOS Platform Routers

This directory contains FastAPI routers that define the API endpoints for the MABOS (Multi-Agent Business Operating System) platform. These routers handle various aspects of the system, including agent management, environment interactions, knowledge representation, planning, and integration with business models and enterprise systems.

## Key Components

1. **Agent Management**: 
   - `agents.py`, `agent_roles.py`: Handle CRUD operations for agents and their roles.
   - `beliefs.py`, `desires.py`, `intentions.py`: Manage BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) components of agents.

2. **Environment and World Model**:
   - `environment.py`, `world_model.py`: Manage the environment state and world model.

3. **Knowledge Representation**:
   - `knowledge_bases.py`, `ontology.py`, `topic_map.py`: Handle different forms of knowledge representation.

4. **Planning and Goals**:
   - `goals.py`, `plans.py`, `planning.py`: Manage goal creation, planning, and execution.

5. **Business Modeling and ERP**:
   - `business_models.py`, `business_plan.py`, `erp.py`: Handle business-related models and ERP integration.

6. **Model-Driven Development (MDD) Integration**:
   - `mdd_mas.py`, `togaf_mdd.py`, `tropos_mdd.py`: Integrate MDD approaches with the MAS.

7. **Version Control**:
   - `version_control.py`: Manage version control operations for the MAS.

8. **Communication and Tasks**:
   - `communication.py`, `tasks.py`: Handle inter-agent communication and task management.

9. **Specialized Services**:
   - `archimate_service.py`, `rules_engine.py`: Provide specialized functionalities like ArchiMate modeling and rule processing.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Each router should focus on a specific domain or functionality of the MABOS platform.
2. Use dependency injection to instantiate services, promoting loose coupling and testability.
3. Implement proper error handling using FastAPI's HTTPException.
4. Use Pydantic models for request and response schemas to ensure data validation.
5. Keep the routing logic separate from the business logic, which should reside in the corresponding services.

## Integration Points

- These routers serve as the API layer, connecting the client applications to the underlying MABOS services.
- They interact closely with the service layer (`app/services/`) to perform operations and retrieve data.
- The routers use models defined in `app/models/` for data representation and validation.

## Future Considerations

- Implement API versioning as the platform evolves.
- Consider adding authentication and authorization middleware for secure access to endpoints.
- Explore the possibility of implementing GraphQL alongside REST for more flexible querying capabilities.
