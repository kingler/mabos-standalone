# API Component

This directory contains the API layer of the MABOS system. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests, routing, and serving as the interface between external clients and the core business logic.

## Structure

- `routes/`: Contains route definitions for different API endpoints
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the API component

## Key Responsibilities

1. Request handling and validation
2. Routing requests to appropriate services
3. Response formatting and error handling
4. API documentation (via FastAPI's automatic documentation)

## Development Guidelines

- Keep route handlers lean, delegating business logic to core services
- Use Pydantic models for request/response data validation
- Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Document all API endpoints using FastAPI's docstring format

## Security Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization for all sensitive endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks
- Use HTTPS for all API communications in production

## Usage Example

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from app.services.business_model_service import BusinessModelService
from app.models.business.business_model import BusinessModelCreate, BusinessModelResponse

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/business-models/", response_model=BusinessModelResponse)
async def create_business_model(model: BusinessModelCreate, service: BusinessModelService = Depends()):
    created_model = await service.create_model(model)
    return created_model
```
