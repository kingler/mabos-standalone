# This update incorporates the new BusinessRulesEngine class with the following changes:
# Added BusinessVocabulary class for managing business terms and verb concepts.
# Introduced BusinessRule class using Pydantic for rule definition.
# Updated BusinessRulesEngine to use the new vocabulary and rule structures.
# Added methods for loading vocabulary and rules from the repository.
# Implemented rule evaluation based on structural and operative rule types.
# Added ontology generation using the owlready2 library.
# The main structure of the file remains the same, but the BusinessRulesEngine class has been significantly modified to accommodate the new requirements. The example usage at the end of the file has been updated to reflect these changes.
# Note that some methods (like load_vocabulary, load_rules, _evaluate_structural_rule, and _evaluate_operative_rule) are left as placeholders and need to be implemented according to your specific requirements.
