# Agent Models Component

This directory contains the data models and structures specific to agents in the MABOS system. These models define the structure and properties of various agent-related concepts, enabling consistent representation and manipulation of agent data throughout the system. Each model plays a crucial role in the functioning of the multi-agent system (MAS) by representing different aspects of agent behavior, capabilities, and interactions.

## Models and Their Roles

### action.py
Defines the `Action` model, which represents actions that an agent can perform. Actions have preconditions and effects, and they are essential for the agent's decision-making and execution processes. This model ensures that actions are executed only when their preconditions are met and updates the agent's beliefs based on the effects.

### agent.py
Contains the core `Agent` model, which represents an agent in the MAS. This model includes attributes such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and roles. It provides methods for the agent to perceive its environment, deliberate on its desires, plan actions, and execute those actions. The `Agent` model is central to the agent's lifecycle and behavior.

### agent_role.py
Defines the `AgentRole` model, which represents the roles that an agent can occupy within the MAS. Roles define the responsibilities and actions associated with an agent, allowing for role-based behavior and organization within the system.

### agent_skill.py
Represents the skills and capabilities of an agent. This model is used to define what an agent can do, which is crucial for matching agents to tasks and roles that require specific skills.

### belief.py
Contains the `Belief` model, which represents the beliefs held by an agent. Beliefs are the agent's knowledge about the world, including the certainty and value of that knowledge. This model is fundamental for the agent's reasoning and decision-making processes.

### desire.py
Defines the `Desire` model, which represents the desires or goals that an agent aims to achieve. Desires have attributes such as priority and status, and they drive the agent's intentions and actions.

### goal.py
Contains the `Goal` model, which represents specific objectives that an agent strives to achieve. Goals can have subgoals and are associated with plans. This model is essential for the hierarchical organization of agent objectives and the decomposition of complex tasks.

### intention.py
Defines the `Intention` model, which represents the intentions of an agent. Intentions are commitments to achieving specific goals and are associated with plans. This model is crucial for the agent's planning and execution processes.

### plan.py
Contains the `Plan` and `PlanStep` models, which represent the plans that an agent creates to achieve its goals. Plans consist of multiple steps, each with specific actions and conditions. This model is vital for the agent's ability to organize and execute complex sequences of actions.

### task.py
Represents tasks that an agent can perform. This model is used to define and manage the tasks assigned to agents, ensuring that they are executed according to the agent's capabilities and goals.

Each of these models plays a specific role in the MAS, contributing to the overall functionality and efficiency of the system. By defining clear and consistent data structures, these models enable robust agent behavior and interaction within the MABOS system.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `action.py`: Model for agent actions
- `agent.py`: Core agent model
- `agent_role.py`: Model for agent roles
- `agent_skill.py`: Model for agent skills and capabilities
- `belief.py`: Model for agent beliefs
- `desire.py`: Model for agent desires
- `goal.py`: Model for agent goals
- `intention.py`: Model for agent intentions
- `plan.py`: Model for agent plans
- `task.py`: Model for agent tasks

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining Pydantic models for agent-related concepts
2. Ensuring data integrity and validation using Pydantic's validation features
3. Facilitating serialization and deserialization of agent data with Pydantic
4. Providing a consistent interface for working with agent-related information through Pydantic models

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for defining data structures and validation
- Focus models on data representation, moving business logic to services
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions for models and their fields
- Implement validation rules using Pydantic field validators where necessary

## Model Implementation

When creating or modifying an agent-related model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and its role within the agent architecture
- Consider relationships and dependencies with other agent models
- Implement appropriate data validation rules using Pydantic
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability and maintainability

## Usage Example

```python
from app.models.agent.agent import Agent
from app.models.agent.goal import Goal

def create_agent_with_goal(agent_data: dict, goal_data: dict):
    goal = Goal(**goal_data)
    agent = Agent(**agent_data, goals=[goal])
    return agent
```
