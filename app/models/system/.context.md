# System Models Component

This directory contains system-wide models and structures that are fundamental to the overall functioning of the MABOS system. These models define the structure and properties of various system-level concepts, providing a foundation for other components to build upon.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `environment.py`: Model for system environment
- `multi_model_view.py`: Model for multi-model system views
- `multiagent_system.py`: Model for the overall multi-agent system
- `organization.py`: Model for organizational structures
- `world_model.py`: Model for the system's world representation
- `world_model_provider.py`: Provider model for world model access

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining core system-wide data structures
2. Ensuring data integrity and validation for system properties
3. Facilitating system-wide operations and interactions
4. Providing a consistent interface for working with system-level information
5. Supporting the integration of various system components

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Implement clear interfaces for system-wide operations and interactions
- Ensure consistency with other model components (agent, business, MDD)
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Model Implementation

When creating or modifying a system-related model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and its role in the overall system architecture
- Consider interactions with other system components and models
- Implement appropriate data validation rules
- Ensure scalability and performance for system-wide use

## Usage Example

```python
from app.models.system.world_model import WorldModel
from app.models.system.environment import Environment

def initialize_system_environment(world_data: dict, env_data: dict):
    world = WorldModel(**world_data)
    environment = Environment(**env_data, world_model=world)
    return environment
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new system-related models or making significant changes to existing ones.
