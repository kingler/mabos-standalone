# Model-Driven Development (MDD) Models Component

This directory contains the models and structures related to Model-Driven Development (MDD) in the MABOS system. These models define the structure and properties of various MDD-related concepts, enabling the system to work with different MDD methodologies and frameworks.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `archimate_model.py`: Model for ArchiMate framework concepts
- `mdd_mas_model.py`: Model for MDD in Multi-Agent Systems
- `togaf_adm.py`: Model for TOGAF Architecture Development Method
- `togaf_mdd_models.py`: TOGAF-specific MDD models
- `tropos_mdd_model.py`: Model for Tropos methodology in MDD

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining data structures for MDD-related concepts
2. Ensuring data integrity and validation for MDD properties
3. Facilitating model transformations and MDD processes
4. Providing a consistent interface for working with MDD-related information
5. Supporting various MDD methodologies and frameworks

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Align model structures with corresponding MDD methodologies and standards
- Implement clear methods for model transformations and interactions
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Model Implementation

When creating or modifying an MDD-related model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and its role in the MDD process
- Consider relationships with other MDD and system models
- Implement appropriate data validation rules
- Ensure consistency with chosen MDD methodology standards

## Usage Example

```python
from app.models.mdd.togaf_mdd_models import TOGAFArchitectureModel
from app.models.mdd.archimate_model import ArchiMateModel

def transform_togaf_to_archimate(togaf_data: dict):
    togaf_model = TOGAFArchitectureModel(**togaf_data)
    archimate_model = ArchiMateModel.from_togaf(togaf_model)
    return archimate_model
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new MDD-related models or making significant changes to existing ones.
