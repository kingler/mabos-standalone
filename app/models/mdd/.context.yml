component: mdd_models
description: Contains models related to Model-Driven Development (MDD) in MABOS
main-technologies:
  - Python
  - Pydantic
  - MDD frameworks
conventions:
  - Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization
  - Align models with MDD methodologies and standards
  - Implement clear interfaces for model transformations
key-responsibilities:
  - Defining data structures for MDD-related concepts
  - Ensuring data integrity and validation for MDD properties
  - Facilitating model transformations and MDD processes
  - Providing a consistent interface for working with MDD-related information
  - Supporting various MDD methodologies and frameworks
development-guidelines:
  - Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
  - Align model structures with corresponding MDD methodologies and standards
  - Implement clear methods for model transformations and interactions
  - Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability
model-implementation:
  - Clearly define the model's purpose and its role in the MDD process
  - Consider relationships with other MDD and system models
  - Implement appropriate data validation rules
  - Ensure consistency with chosen MDD methodology standards
