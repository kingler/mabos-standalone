# Business Models Component

This directory contains the data models and structures related to business concepts in the MABOS system. These models define the structure and properties of various business-related entities, enabling consistent representation and manipulation of business data throughout the system.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `business_model.py`: Core business model representation
- `business_plan.py`: Model for business plans
- `business_profile.py`: Model for business profiles

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining data structures for business-related concepts
2. Ensuring data integrity and validation for business properties
3. Facilitating serialization and deserialization of business data
4. Providing a consistent interface for working with business-related information
5. Aligning data representation with business ontology definitions

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Align model structures with corresponding concepts in the business ontology
- Implement clear methods for model interactions and transformations
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Model Implementation

When creating or modifying a business-related model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and its role in business modeling
- Consider relationships with other business and system models
- Implement appropriate data validation rules
- Ensure consistency with business ontology definitions

## Usage Example

```python
from app.models.business.business_model import BusinessModel
from app.models.business.business_plan import BusinessPlan

def create_business_plan(model_data: dict, plan_data: dict):
    business_model = BusinessModel(**model_data)
    business_plan = BusinessPlan(**plan_data, model=business_model)
    return business_plan
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new business-related models or making significant changes to existing ones.
