# Reasoning Models Component

This directory contains the models and structures that support the reasoning capabilities of the MABOS system. These models define the structure and properties of various reasoning-related concepts, enabling sophisticated decision-making and inference processes.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `htn_planner.py`: Hierarchical Task Network planning model
- `inference_result.py`: Model for inference results
- `reasoner.py`: Core reasoner model
- `reasoning_behavior.py`: Model for reasoning behaviors
- `reasoning_engine.py`: Engine model for executing reasoning processes
- `reasoning_rule.py`: Model for reasoning rules
- `temporal_reasoning.py`: Model for temporal reasoning capabilities

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining data structures for reasoning-related concepts
2. Ensuring data integrity and validation for reasoning properties
3. Facilitating the execution of reasoning and inference processes
4. Providing a consistent interface for working with reasoning-related information
5. Supporting various reasoning paradigms (e.g., rule-based, temporal)

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Implement clear interfaces for reasoning operations and rule definitions
- Align reasoning models with ontology and knowledge representation standards
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Model Implementation

When creating or modifying a reasoning-related model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and its role in the reasoning process
- Consider interactions with other knowledge and reasoning components
- Implement appropriate data validation rules
- Ensure consistency with ontology and knowledge base structures

## Usage Example

```python
from app.tools.reasoner import Reasoner
from app.models.knowledge.reasoning.reasoning_rule import ReasoningRule

def apply_reasoning(data: dict, rule_data: dict):
    rule = ReasoningRule(**rule_data)
    reasoner = Reasoner(rules=[rule])
    result = reasoner.apply(data)
    return result
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new reasoning-related models or making significant changes to existing ones.
