# Core Models Component

This directory contains the data models, knowledge representation structures, and domain-specific models used throughout the MABOS system. It provides a centralized location for defining the structure and behavior of data within the application.

## Structure

- `agent/`: Models related to agent structures and behaviors
- `business/`: Business-related models and structures
- `knowledge/`: Knowledge representation models and ontologies
- `mdd/`: Model-Driven Development related models
- `system/`: System-wide and environmental models

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining data structures and relationships
2. Implementing data validation and type checking
3. Providing serialization and deserialization capabilities
4. Representing domain knowledge and ontologies

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Implement clear methods for model interactions and transformations
- Keep models focused on data representation, moving business logic to services
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Model Implementation

When creating a new model:
- Clearly define the model's purpose and structure
- Implement validation rules using Pydantic field validators
- Consider relationships with other models in the system
- Implement methods for common operations or transformations on the model

## Knowledge Representation

- Use OWL or similar standards for ontology representation
- Implement clear interfaces for querying and updating knowledge bases
- Consider using reasoning engines for complex knowledge operations

## Testing Models

- Create unit tests for model validation and methods
- Test edge cases and invalid inputs
- Implement serialization/deserialization tests

## Usage Example

```python
from app.models.business.business_model import BusinessModel

def create_business_model(data: dict):
    model = BusinessModel(**data)
    return model
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new models or making significant changes to existing ones.
