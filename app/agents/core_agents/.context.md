# Core Agents Component

This directory contains implementations of various agent types used in the MABOS system. Each agent type is designed to handle specific behaviors and responsibilities within the multi-agent system.

## Core Agents Components

1. **agent_types.py**: Defines the base `Agent` class and common agent types such as `EnvironmentalAgent`, `ProactiveAgent`, and `ReactiveAgent`. This file is crucial as it establishes the fundamental structure and behaviors that all agents in the system inherit and build upon.
2. **broker.py**: Implements the `Broker` class, a message broker that facilitates communication between agents. It keeps track of registered agents and their locations, routing messages between them. This is essential for enabling interaction and coordination among agents in the multi-agent system (MAS).
3. **business_agent.py**: Contains the `BusinessAgent` class, a specialized agent for business-related tasks. It handles operations such as transaction processing and business logic execution, making it vital for business process automation within the MAS.
4. **business_plan_agent.py**: Defines the `BusinessPlanAgent` class, which develops comprehensive business plans using a predefined template. This agent leverages various skills and knowledge bases to generate detailed business plans, playing a key role in strategic planning and decision-making.
5. **code_generation_agent.py**: Contains the `CodeGenerationAgent` class, responsible for transforming high-level models into executable code. This agent generates agent implementations, communication interfaces, and knowledge bases, facilitating the development and deployment of domain-specific MAS.
6. **environmental_agent.py**: Defines the `EnvironmentalAgent` class, an agent that interacts with and perceives the environment. It updates its beliefs based on environmental changes and acts accordingly, making it essential for real-time environmental monitoring and response.
7. **llm_agent.py**: Contains the `LLMAgent` class, an agent leveraging Large Language Models for advanced reasoning and natural language processing tasks. This agent processes messages, handles requests, and generates responses, enhancing the MAS with sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities.
8. **maintenance_agent.py**: Defines the `MaintenanceAgent` class, which automates maintenance tasks such as cache management. This agent ensures the system's smooth operation by performing routine maintenance, making it crucial for system reliability and performance.
9. **proactive_agent.py**: Contains the `ProactiveAgent` class, a goal-oriented agent capable of planning and executing actions to achieve its goals. This agent deliberates on goals, generates plans, and executes them, playing a key role in proactive behavior and long-term goal achievement within the MAS.
10. **reactive_agent.py**: Defines the `ReactiveAgent` class, an agent that responds to stimuli based on predefined rules. It reacts to changes in the environment in real-time, making it essential for immediate and adaptive responses to dynamic conditions.
11. **security_agent.py**: Contains the `SecurityAgent` class, responsible for secure communication and monitoring. This agent ensures the integrity and confidentiality of agent interactions, playing a critical role in maintaining the security and trustworthiness of the MAS.

## Structure

- `agent_types.py`: Defines the base Agent class and common agent types
- `broker.py`: Implements the message broker for agent communication
- `business_agent.py`: Specialized agent for business-related tasks
- `business_plan_agent.py`: Develops comprehensive business plans using a predefined template
- `code_generation_agent.py`: Transforms high-level models into executable code
- `environmental_agent.py`: Agent that interacts with and perceives the environment
- `llm_agent.py`: Agent leveraging Large Language Models for advanced reasoning
- `maintenance_agent.py`: Automates maintenance tasks such as cache management
- `proactive_agent.py`: Agent capable of goal-oriented behavior and planning
- `reactive_agent.py`: Agent that responds to stimuli based on predefined rules
- `security_agent.py`: Agent responsible for secure communication and monitoring

## Key Responsibilities

1. Implement various agent behaviors and decision-making processes using Pydantic models
2. Handle agent communication and interaction
3. Manage agent beliefs, desires, and intentions following the BDI architecture
4. Execute agent-specific tasks and actions
5. Utilize OpenAI's API for natural language processing tasks
6. Ensure secure communication and monitoring within the MAS

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for defining agent structures and properties.
- Implement specific agent behaviors in separate classes, inheriting from the base `Agent` class.
- Follow the naming convention of *Agent for all agent classes.
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability and maintainability.
- Implement unit tests for each agent type to ensure proper functionality.
- Utilize OpenAI's API for natural language processing tasks where applicable.
- Ensure secure communication and monitoring within the MAS.
