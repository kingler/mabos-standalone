# UI Agents Component

This directory contains implementations of user interface agents used in the MABOS system. These agents are responsible for handling user interactions and managing the onboarding process for new businesses.

## UI Agents Components

1. **__init__.py**: Initialization file for the ui_agents package.
2. **onboarding_agent.py**: Contains the `OnboardingAgent` class, which is responsible for conducting the onboarding process for new businesses. This agent interacts with users, collects business information, and initializes the MABOS system for a new client.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the ui_agents package
- `onboarding_agent.py`: Implements the OnboardingAgent for business onboarding

## Key Responsibilities

1. Implement user interface agents for interacting with the MABOS system
2. Handle the onboarding process for new businesses
3. Collect and process business information
4. Generate business descriptions and ontologies
5. Initialize MABOS agents for new clients

## Development Guidelines

- Use Pydantic models for defining agent structures and properties
- Implement specific agent behaviors in separate classes
- Follow the naming convention of *Agent for all agent classes
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability and maintainability
- Implement unit tests for each agent type to ensure proper functionality
- Utilize asynchronous programming techniques for improved performance

## Usage Example

### Example: Using the OnboardingAgent
