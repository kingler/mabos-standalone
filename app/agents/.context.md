# Agents Component

This directory contains the implementations of various agents within the MABOS multi-agent system. Each agent is designed to perform specific tasks and interact with other agents to achieve the system's goals.

## Structure

- `base/`: Base classes for agents, providing common functionalities and interfaces.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the base package.
  - `agent_base.py`: Defines the base agent class with core functionalities.
  - `base_models.py`: Contains base models used across different agent types.

- `core_agents/`: Core agent implementations that handle primary business logic and operations.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the core_agents package.
  - `agent_types.py`: Defines various agent types and their characteristics.
  - `broker.py`: Implements the broker agent for coordinating interactions.
  - `business_agent.py`: Handles general business-related tasks.
  - `business_plan_agent.py`: Specializes in business plan creation and management.
  - `code_generation_agent.py`: Focuses on automated code generation tasks.
  - `environmental_agent.py`: Manages environmental considerations and sustainability.
  - `llm_agent.py`: Interfaces with language models for various tasks.
  - `maintenance_agent.py`: Handles system maintenance and updates.
  - `proactive_agent.py`: Implements proactive behaviors and planning.

- `meta_agents/`: Meta-agent implementations that manage higher-level tasks such as architecture design and domain modeling.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the meta_agents package.
  - `agent_design_agent.py`: Specializes in designing new agent types.
  - `architecture_design_agent.py`: Focuses on system architecture design.
  - `database_agent.py`: Manages database operations and optimizations.
  - `deployment_agent.py`: Handles system deployment processes.
  - `domain_modeling_agent.py`: Specializes in domain-specific modeling.
  - `implementation_agent.py`: Oversees implementation of system components.
  - `integration_agent.py`: Manages integration of various system parts.
  - `meta_agents.py`: Defines base classes for meta-agents.
  - `meta_mas.py`: Implements the meta-level multi-agent system.
  - `monitoring_agent.py`: Focuses on system monitoring and reporting.
  - `ontology_engineering_agent.py`: Manages ontology development and maintenance.
  - `operational_meta_agent.py`: Oversees operational aspects of the system.
  - `optimization_agent.py`: Specializes in system optimization tasks.
  - `requirements_analysis_agent.py`: Handles requirements gathering and analysis.
  - `strategic_meta_agent.py`: Manages high-level strategic planning.
  - `tactical_meta_agent.py`: Focuses on tactical decision-making.
  - `testing_and_verification_agent.py`: Manages system testing and verification processes.

- `ui_agents/`: Agents focused on user interface interactions and onboarding processes.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the ui_agents package.
  - `onboarding_agent.py`: Handles user onboarding and initial setup processes.

## Key Responsibilities

1. Implementing the core functionalities of the multi-agent system.
2. Facilitating communication and coordination between agents.
3. Handling specific tasks and operations as defined by their roles.
4. Ensuring modularity and clear separation of concerns in agent design.

## Development Guidelines

- Keep agent implementations modular and focused on single responsibilities.
- Use the strategy pattern for interchangeable agent behaviors.
- Implement comprehensive logging for agent actions and decision-making processes.
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability.

## Agent Development

When developing new agents or modifying existing ones:
- Clearly define the agent's goals and behaviors.
- Consider interactions with other agents in the system.
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Document the agent's decision-making process and key algorithms.

## Example Agent

Refer to the `BusinessPlanAgent` implementation for an example of a well-structured agent:
