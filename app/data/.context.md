# Data Component

This directory houses the data files, resources, and data management utilities used by the MABOS system. It serves as a centralized location for managing static data, seed data, and data processing scripts.

## Structure

- `2022_naics_codes.csv`: NAICS codes data file
- `business_description.md`: Template or example business descriptions
- Other data files and resources

## Key Responsibilities

1. Storing static data used across the system
2. Providing seed data for database initialization
3. Housing data processing and transformation scripts
4. Maintaining data dictionaries and schemas

## Development Guidelines

- Keep data files in standard, easily parseable formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Document the source and last update date for each data file
- Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity
- Use version control for tracking changes in data files

## Data Management

When adding or updating data files:
- Ensure the data is clean and properly formatted
- Update any associated documentation or data dictionaries
- Consider the impact on existing system functionality
- Implement proper error handling for data loading and processing

## Data Privacy and Security

- Do not store sensitive or personal information in this directory
- Implement access controls to restrict data access in production environments
- Consider data anonymization techniques for any potentially sensitive information

## Usage Example

```python
import csv
from pathlib import Path

def load_naics_codes():
    naics_file = Path(__file__).parent / '2022_naics_codes.csv'
    with open(naics_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        return list(reader)
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory with any significant changes to the data structure or new data files added.
