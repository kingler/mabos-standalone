## TOGAF Integration and ArchiMate Notation

We are using TOGAF ADM for our architecture development. The most relevant phases for our organization are:
- Phase A: Architecture Vision
- Phase B: Business Architecture
- Phase C: Information Systems Architectures
- Phase D: Technology Architecture
- Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions

We use ArchiMate for visualizing our architecture models, focusing on:
- Business layer: actors, roles, processes, and services
- Application layer: application components and services
- Technology layer: infrastructure and platforms
- Motivation extension: goals, drivers, and principles

Our architecture team ensures consistency in ArchiMate models through regular reviews, a shared metamodel, and automated validation tools.
