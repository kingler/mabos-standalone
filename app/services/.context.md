# Core Services Component

This directory contains the service layer implementations for core MABOS functionalities. These services encapsulate the business logic of the system, orchestrating interactions between models, agents, and external systems.

## Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initialization and common imports
- `agent_service.py`: Service for agent-related operations
- `business_model_service.py`: Service for business model operations
- `knowledge_base_service.py`: Service for knowledge base interactions
- `ontology_service.py`: Service for ontology management
- `planning_service.py`: Service for planning and strategy operations
- Other service implementations...

## Key Responsibilities

1. Implementing core business logic of the MABOS system
2. Orchestrating interactions between different system components
3. Providing a clean API for the application layer
4. Managing complex operations and transactions
5. Ensuring consistency and integrity of system operations

## Development Guidelines

- Implement services as classes with clear, single responsibilities
- Use dependency injection for service dependencies
- Implement asynchronous methods for I/O-bound operations
- Keep services stateless when possible to improve scalability
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Service Implementation

When creating a new service:
- Clearly define the service's purpose and responsibilities
- Implement methods for all required operations
- Use dependency injection to manage service dependencies
- Consider implementing an interface or abstract base class for the service

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling within services
- Use custom exception classes for specific error scenarios
- Provide meaningful error messages and context

## Testing Services

- Implement unit tests for individual service methods
- Create integration tests for services that interact with external systems
- Use mocking to isolate service tests from external dependencies

## Usage Example

```python
from app.services.business_model_service import BusinessModelService
from app.models.business.business_model import BusinessModelCreate

async def create_new_business_model(data: dict):
    service = BusinessModelService()
    model_data = BusinessModelCreate(**data)
    new_model = await service.create_model(model_data)
    return new_model
```

Remember to update the `README.md` in this directory when adding new services or making significant changes to existing ones.
