component: e2e_tests
description: Contains end-to-end tests for the MABOS system
main-technologies:
  - Python
  - pytest
  - FastAPI TestClient
conventions:
  - Use pytest for test definitions
  - Simulate real-world scenarios in tests
  - Use meaningful test case names
  - Implement proper setup and teardown procedures
key-responsibilities:
  - Testing complete user workflows
  - Verifying system-wide integration
  - Ensuring all components work together correctly
  - Simulating real-world usage scenarios
  - Catching issues that unit tests might miss
development-guidelines:
  - Use pytest for defining and running tests
  - Implement tests that cover complete user workflows
  - Use meaningful and descriptive names for test functions
  - Implement proper setup and teardown procedures to ensure test isolation
  - Use FastAPI's TestClient for API-related E2E tests
test-implementation:
  - Clearly define the scenario being tested
  - Set up the necessary test data and environment
  - Simulate user actions and system interactions
  - Verify the expected outcomes
  - Clean up any resources created during the test
test-data-management:
  - Use fixtures or factory functions to generate test data
  - Consider using a separate test database for E2E tests
  - Implement proper data cleanup after each test
continuous-integration:
  - Ensure E2E tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline
  - Consider running E2E tests in a staging environment that closely mimics production
