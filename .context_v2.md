# MABOS (Multi-Agent Based Organizational System)

MABOS is an advanced platform designed to assist businesses in modeling, strategizing, and optimizing their operations using multi-agent systems and model-driven development approaches. It integrates the PADE framework for enhanced agent capabilities and communication.

## Key Components

1. **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**
   - Utilizes PADE framework for agent implementation
   - Supports various agent types (e.g., business agents, environmental agents)
   - Implements FIPA-compliant agent communication

2. **Model-Driven Development (MDD) Framework**
   - Supports creation and management of system models
   - Integrates with enterprise architecture frameworks (e.g., TOGAF, ArchiMate)
   - Facilitates model transformations and code generation

3. **Ontology-based Knowledge Representation**
   - Manages domain knowledge using OWL ontologies
   - Supports reasoning and inference capabilities
   - Integrates with natural language processing for user interactions

4. **Business Modeling and Strategy Tools**
   - Generates and analyzes business models
   - Supports strategy development and evaluation
   - Integrates with MDD framework for model-based approaches

5. **Knowledge Management System**
   - Centralizes knowledge acquisition and storage
   - Implements version control for knowledge bases
   - Supports knowledge sharing across system components

## System Architecture

1. **Agent Layer**: PADE-based agents implementing various roles and behaviors
2. **Core Services**: Business logic and coordination services
3. **Knowledge Management**: Ontology and knowledge base management
4. **Model Management**: MDD tools and model transformation services
5. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based endpoints for external interactions
6. **Persistence Layer**: ArangoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval

## Key Features

1. **Intelligent Business Modeling**: Automated generation and analysis of business models
2. **Agent-based Decision Support**: Simulations and scenario analysis for strategy evaluation
3. **Knowledge-Driven Architecture**: Ontology-based reasoning and inference capabilities
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement through agent interactions and feedback
5. **Extensible Framework**: Support for custom agents, models, and domain-specific ontologies

## Development Guidelines

- Utilize PADE's agent development patterns and best practices
- Adhere to FIPA standards for agent communication
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing for agents and services
- Maintain clear documentation for agent behaviors and interactions
- Follow modular design principles for scalability and maintainability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- ArangoDB 3.10 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mabos.git
   cd mabos
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up ArangoDB:
   - Install ArangoDB following the official documentation
   - Create a new database named 'mabos'
   - Update the database configuration in `app/config/settings.py`

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Docker Deployment (Optional)

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t mabos:latest .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 mabos:latest
   ```
