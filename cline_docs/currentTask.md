## Current Context
The project requires immediate attention in four critical areas:

1. Code Organization
   - Multiple redundant service implementations
   - Unused files and scripts
   - Duplicate configuration files
   - Overlapping model definitions

2. Database Infrastructure
   - Current setup lacks resilience
   - Basic error handling needs enhancement
   - Connection management needs improvement

3. Security Framework
   - Basic authentication needs strengthening
   - Role-based access control required
   - API security measures needed

4. Service Architecture
   - Service initialization needs improvement
   - Health monitoring required
   - Error handling needs enhancement
